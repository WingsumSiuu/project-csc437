Some details

- The shop view is hard coded (largely the original HTML I had from the earlier labs). User, field, bees, eggs, and bears are stored in their respective Collections.

If not logged in:
- If the user is not logged in, they can visit the home page and view static information pages (about the game, info is not guaranteed to be factual (it definitely isn't))

If logged In:
- If the user is logged in, they have access to their profile page where they can edit their info
- They also have access to their pollen page (a cookie-clicker-esque page) that uses their display name (ie their in game name), profile picture, and specified color as a border around the image (or that neon yellow if left unchanged).
- Level...is there in the profile for (perhaps) aesthetic reasons 

Tester login info (has some non-default profile data, ie avoids the bright yellow borders)
- user id: sophisticated
- password: sophisticated

Thank you for the quarter!
